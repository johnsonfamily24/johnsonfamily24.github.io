Greetings from the 2024 Johnson Family Reunion Planning Committee! We have been working hard planning a weekend with family-friendly activities for everyone. The Johnson Reunion will be held Saturday, July 27th – Sunday, July 28th, 2024 in Addis, Louisiana. 

This year’s theme is: **Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! (Psalms 133:1, KJV).** 

Our reunion colors are Caribbean Blue and Gray. Let’s make this Family Reunion one to remember! We are hoping to see all of you in Louisiana in July!
